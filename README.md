## Testing üß™

This application uses **Pest** for testing, a delightful PHP testing framework that helps you write clear and expressive tests.

### Setup Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

Before running the tests, ensure your environment is correctly configured:

1. **Ensure Pest is Installed**:  
   If Pest is not installed in your project yet, you can add it via Composer:
   ```bash
   composer require pestphp/pest --dev
   ```

2. **Initialize Pest**:  
   After installation, initialize Pest in your project:
   ```bash
   php artisan pest:install
   ```

3. **Create the `.env.testing` File**:  
   In the root directory of your project, create a `.env.testing` file with the following content:
   ```env
    APP_ENV=testing
    APP_KEY=base64:+EhHUCsv8cRrKva+QijNRmA7bf7Uk1FkBht5i1r0LdA=

    LOG_CHANNEL=stack
    LOG_LEVEL=debug

    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    DB_DATABASE=:memory:

    CACHE_DRIVER=array
    QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
    SESSION_DRIVER=array
    MAIL_MAILER=log
   ```

4. **Generate the Application Key**:  
   If you haven't generated an application key yet, you can do so for your testing environment with:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate --env=testing
   ```

### Running Tests

Once your environment is set up, you can run the test suite using the following command:
```bash
